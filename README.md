# NetLynk
2-Way Bindable Blynk API Wrapper in NET Core

This is a small library I've written in one day for a gig, and wanted to share it publicly. Still work in progress. 

Library only works for button widgets as for now and you're welcome to contribute.

# ToDo List

- [ ] Add tests and make CI integration
- [ ] Support more widget types
- [ ] Publish to NuGet
